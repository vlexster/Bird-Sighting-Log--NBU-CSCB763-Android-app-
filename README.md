# Bird Sighting Log
A simple bird watching sightings log

###About
This is a simple Android App I've been developing on and off for the past month or so. It is a Bird Watching Sighting Log, where one can log whatever species they've seen in order to track migrations, conduct researches, etc. All entries are saved in a local SQLite3 DB.

###Features
* Displaying the already logged sightings
* The capability to add new sightings
* The capability to delete ones, once they're no longer desired
* Hidden delete button, being shown upon a long click on the list item
* Hiding the delete button again, by long clicking the list item again, in order to prevent an unwanted entry deletion
* Toast notifications upon succesful deletion
